* As a user I want an introduction page that explains the requirements (rules) of walking my dog
* As a user I want a clean interface with graphics of the dog and the "tools" you need to walk him (leash, bags, treats)
* As a user I want buttons which clearly provide information regarding the choices I can make to progress the walk: ___give treats, look out for squirrels, pick up poop, etc.___
* As a user I want to be able to click the buttons - thus moving onto the next part of the walk
* As a user I want to be presented with a message when I have successfully completed the walk and an image the dog has made it safely home
