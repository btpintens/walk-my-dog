    <h1>Walk My Dog</h1>
    <h2 class="intro">
      Try to walk this tiny rascal without getting distracted or falling for
      any of his tricks. If you both make it home in one piece you will be
      rewarded with so much money. Don't forget to bring all the tools I left
      for you - you'll need them to complete the walk and get back home.

    <h2 class="page-four hidden">
        A stranger is coming our way. What do you do?
