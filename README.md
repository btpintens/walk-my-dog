# walk-my-dog

My game is called Walk My Dog (inspired by my own dog who is a mischevious demon on a string). Walk My Dog is a choose your own adventure game with multiple choices on each level leading the player on various different paths. Throughout the game the player will encounter various challenges that will either terminate the game or allow the player to continue. 

* As a user I want an introduction page that explains the requirements (rules) of walking my dog
* As a user I want a clean interface with graphics of the dog and the "tools" you need to walk him (leash, bags, treats)
* As a user I want a constant visual reminder of how many tools (kind and quantity) I have left
* As a user I want buttons which clearly provide information regarding the choices I can make to progress the walk: ___give treats, look out for squirrels, pick up poop, etc.___
* As a user I want to be able to click the buttons - thus moving onto the next part of the walk
* As a user I want to be presented with a message when I have successfully completed the walk and an image the dog has made it safely home
* As a user I want to know how much money I earned (points I have) once I have completed the walk (finished the game)
