My game is called Walk My Dog (inspired by my own dog who is a mischevious demon on a string). Walk My Dog is a choose your own adventure game with multiple choices on each level leading the player on various different paths. Throughout the game the player will encounter various challenges that will either terminate the game or allow the player to continue. 

## Hope you enjoy!

### Future Steps 

- As a player I would like to encorporate complex challenges beyond the 3-choice option on each level. These challenges would come with more complex "rewards": ___ex: taking pictures, having the dog do tricks, dressing the dog according to weather___ would all gain more money and/tools 
- As a player I would like an audio component - dog barking - that would contribute to various clues/guidance/challenges
- As a player I would like the animation to correspond with choices made during the game (basic dog commands: sit, stay, shake, etc.) as well as reflecting the change in environment as the walk progresses (based on weather, location, activity, etc. )
- As a player I would like to be able to create a profile and maintain points and tools each time I play the game 
- As a player I would like the ability to purchase additional tools thus extending gameplay and - ultimately - earn more money. Potentially adding pop-up trivia questions which would further add to money.
